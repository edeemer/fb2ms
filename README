Fb2ms is a program for converting e-books from FictionBook 2 format
(fb2) to troff -ms macros. Produced output could be fed e. g. to
nroff(1) to produce pretty formatted text file:

	fb2ms <book.fb2 | nroff -ms >book.txt

or to troff(1) for printable documents:

	fb2ms <book.fb2 | troff -ms | dpost >book.ps

The style could be changed easily by changing -ms macro files. But due
to the lack of some fb2 features in -ms macros (such as poems and
epigraphs), fb2ms produces pure troff instructions for those cases.

Fb2ms does NOT support these essential features:
	1. graphical images
	2. tables
	3. references at footnotes

To compile a program you need to have Expat library. Then execute

	make

in this directory. For installation run

	make install
